# Meter Readings Exercise

## User Story
As an Energy Company Account Manager, I want to be able to load a CSV file of Customer Meter Readings So that we can monitor their energy consumption and charge them accordingly.

## Improvements that could be made
- Add Unit Tests
- Better error handling in most places
- Improve status codes
- Connection string in config
- More efficient use of adding with referential integrity
- Add an Update/PUT for meter readings
